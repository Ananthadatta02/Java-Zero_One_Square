# Java-Zero_One_Square
This Java program generates a square pattern of alternating 1s and 0s based on user input for the size. It uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns, printing 1 if the sum of indices is even and 0 if odd. The result is a checkerboard-like pattern. The program utilizes Scanner for input and prints the pattern in a structured format.
